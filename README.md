# Paranoid Android

This is small sensor project for gathering weather information from my backyard, just a few steps away from my garden.

This is the brains of the project, flashed on a Particle Photon that manages communication between the internet and a handful of sensors.

The facade of the project is housed in [Sturmbaum](https://github.com/jsulz/sturmbaum) (that's "storm tree" if you're rusty on your German) and is publicly visible at [https://weather.jsulz.com/](https://weather.jsulz.com/).
